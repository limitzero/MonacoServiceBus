-- verbalize state machine:
	   
	  Initially when (message arrives) it will {call the appropriate code} and 
	     [publish, send, reply, delay, complete] and/or transition to [state]
	  
	  Then [state] is triggered and when (message arrives) it will {call the appropriate code} and 
	     [publish, send, reply, delay, complete] and/or transition to [state]
